## Why Your Resume Isn't Getting Selected

In today's competitive job market, getting your resume noticed is harder than ever. Companies use advanced Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter out candidates before a human even sees your application. If your resume contains these common mistakes, you're likely being rejected automatically.

Here are the 10 most critical resume mistakes you must avoid in 2026:

### 1. Using Creative Columns and Graphics
While a visually stunning resume might look great to you, ATS software struggles to parse complex layouts. Stick to a clean, single-column format to ensure your information is read correctly.
**Fix:** prioritize readability and standard formatting over flashy design elements.

### 2. Including a Photo
Unless you are applying for a modeling or acting role, including a photo can lead to bias and discrimination concerns. Many companies automatically discard resumes with photos to avoid legal issues.
**Fix:** Remove your headshot. Let your skills and experience speak for themselves.

### 3. Generic "Objective" Statements
Old-school objectives like "Seeking a challenging position to utilize my skills" are outdated and vague. Recruiters want to know what value *you* bring to *them*.
**Fix:** replace your objective with a powerful "Professional Summary" that highlights your key achievements and career trajectory.

### 4. Ignoring Keywords form the Job Description
ATS scanners look for specific keywords related to the job description. If your resume doesn't mimic the language of the job posting, you won't rank high enough to satisfy the algorithm.
**Fix:** Tailor your resume for every application. Use tools like **PlaceNxt's AI Resume Scorer** to identify missing keywords.

### 5. Listing Duties Instead of Achievements
Don't just list what you were responsible for; show what you accomplished. "Responsible for sales" is weak. "Increased sales revenue by 20% in Q3" is improved.
**Fix:** Use action verbs and quantify your results with numbers, percentages, and dollar amounts.

### 6. Typographical and Grammatical Errors
Detail-oriented is a common requirement. A typo in your resume suggests you lack attention to detail.
**Fix:** Proofread multiple times. Use Grammarly or have a friend review it.

### 7. Unprofessional Email Addresses
Using an email like \`cool_dude_99@hotmail.com\` looks unprofessional.
**Fix:** Create a dedicated professional email address, ideally format \`firstname.lastname@gmail.com\`.

### 8. Including Irrelevant Information
Hobbies, marital status, or primary school grades clutter your resume and distract from your professional qualifications.
**Fix:** Keep it relevant. If it doesn't prove you can do the job, cut it.

### 9. Incorrect File Format
Sending a Word document can result in formatting errors on the recruiter's screen.
**Fix:** Always save and submit your resume as a **PDF**, unless the application specifically requests a Word doc.

### 10. Making it Too Long
Recruiters spend an average of 7 seconds scanning a resume. If it's 3-4 pages long, they won't find the important stuff.
**Fix:** Keep it to 1 page for less than 10 years of experience, and strictly 2 pages for senior roles.

## Conclusion
Your resume is your ticket to the interview. By avoiding these common pitfalls and optimizing for both ATS and human readers, you significantly increase your chances of success. Use **PlaceNxt's AI Resume Analyzer** today to get a free comprehensive score and actionable feedback!
