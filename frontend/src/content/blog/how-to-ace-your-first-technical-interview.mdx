## Types of Technical Interviews

Technical interviews can be daunting, especially for fresh graduates. Understanding the format is the first step to conquering them.

### 1. The Screening Round
Usually a phone or video call with a recruiter or junior engineer. They will ask basic questions about your background, projects, and potentially a simple coding problem.
**Goal:** Verify you are who you say you are and have basic competency.

### 2. The Coding Assessment (OA)
An online test on platforms like HackerRank or CodeSignal. You'll be given 1-3 algorithmic problems to solve within a time limit.
**Tip:** Practice speed and accuracy on LeetCode. Focus on Arrays, Strings, and HashMaps.

### 3. The On-Site / Virtual On-Site
This is the main event. It typically consists of 3-5 rounds spanning a full day.
*   **Coding Rounds:** Whiteboard style problems (e.g., "Invert a Binary Tree").
*   **System Design:** Designing scalable systems (e.g., "Design Twitter").
*   **Behavioral:** Assessing culture fit (e.g., "Tell me about a time you failed").

## Essential Topics to Master

To ace these rounds, you need a solid grasp of Computer Science fundamentals:
*   **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, Heaps.
*   **Algorithms:** Sorting, Searching (Binary Search), Recursion, Dynamic Programming, BFS/DFS.
*   **Big O Notation:** analyzing time and space complexity is crucial.

## The STAR Method for Behavioral Questions
Don't neglect the soft skills. Use the **STAR** technique to structure your answers:
*   **S**ituation: Set the scene.
*   **T**ask: Describe your responsibility.
*   **A**ction: Explain exactly what steps you took.
*   **R**esult: Share the outcome (quantify if possible).

## Practice Makes Perfect
The best way to prepare is through mock interviews.
*   **Peer Mocks:** Practice with friends.
*   **AI Mock Interviews:** Use **PlaceNxt's AI Interviewer** to simulate real scenarios, get instant feedback on your code and communication, and track your progress.

**Start practicing daily and you'll walk into that interview room with confidence!**
