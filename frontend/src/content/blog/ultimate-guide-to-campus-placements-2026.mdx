## The Campus Placement Process Demystified

For final-year students, placements are the most crucial phase of college life. Here is what the typical funnel looks like and how to clear each stage.

*   **Logical Reasoning:** Data Interpretation, Patterns, Blood Relations.
*   **Technical MCQ:** Core CS concepts (OS, DBMS, CN, OOPs).
