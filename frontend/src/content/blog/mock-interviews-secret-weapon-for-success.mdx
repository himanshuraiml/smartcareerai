## Why You Fail Interviews (It's Not Lack of Skill)

Often, candidates fail not because they don't know the answer, but because they freeze up, ramble, or fail to communicate their thought process clearly. The antidote to anxiety is familiarity.

### Benefits of Mock Interviews

1.  **Reduce Anxiety:** By simulating the pressure environment, you desensitize yourself to the stress.
2.  **Identify Weaknesses:** You might think you know "Binary Search", but explaining it out loud reveals gaps in your understanding.
3.  **Improve Communication:** Practice articulating your thoughts while coding.
4.  **Time Management:** Learn to pace yourself to solve problems within the 30-45 minute window.

### Traditional Mocks vs. AI Mocks
*   **Peer Mocks:** Great for interaction, but feedback can be biased or limited by your peer's knowledge.
*   **Paid Expert Mocks:** innovative and high quality, but expensive ($100+ per session).
*   **AI Mock Interviews (PlaceNxt):**
    *   **Unlimited Practice:** Run as many sessions as you need.
    *   **Instant Feedback:** precise analysis of your code efficiency, speech clarity, and body language.
    *   **Cost-Effective:** Included in your PlaceNxt subscription (free tier available!).

## How to Conduct an Effective Mock
1.  Treat it like the real thing. Dress up, sit at a desk, remove distractions.
2.  Record yourself. Watching the replay is painful but incredibly educational.
3.  Focus on the *process*, not just the *answer*.

**Don't practice until you get it right. Practice until you can't get it wrong.**
